### Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Start with one city.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Run `glm` for each of the cities in the dataset. And extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing Black
victims to white victims.

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))  %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceWhite")
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,30), breaks=1)
```

We could find the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. And some of them,
like Albuquerque,NM or Stockton,CA, have relatively larger OR and wider
CI. Moreover, we could find that altought most of our estimated ORs are
pretty close to 1,there are more ORs’ point estimates are greater than
1, which means that when comparing Black victims to white victims,
homicides of white victims are more likely results in arrest. When
looking and CIs, some(like a half) are above 1, which means for these
cities, we might can conclude that homicides of white victims are more
likely results in arrest.

## Problem 2

Load and clean the data for regression analysis

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(case_when(
      babysex == 1 ~ "male",
      babysex == 2 ~ "female"
      )),
    frace = factor(case_when(
      frace == 1 ~ "White",
      frace == 2 ~ "Black",
      frace == 3 ~ "Asian",
      frace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
      frace == 8 ~ "Other"
    )),
    malform = factor(case_when(
      malform == 0 ~ "absent",
      malform == 1 ~ "present"
      )),
    mrace = factor(case_when(
      mrace == 1 ~ "White",
      mrace == 2 ~ "Black",
      mrace == 3 ~ "Asian",
      mrace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
      mrace == 8 ~ "Other"
    ))
  )
```

    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Want to find some reasonable predictors for our model. First, take a
look on all variables:

``` r
baby_df %>% 
  lm(bwt~.,data = .) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  filter(p.value <= 0.05)
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 x 5
    ##   term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept) -6307.     659.        -9.57 1.80e- 21
    ## 2 babysexmale   -28.7      8.47      -3.39 7.02e-  4
    ## 3 bhead         131.       3.45      37.9  2.16e-271
    ## 4 blength        75.0      2.02      37.1  1.75e-261
    ## 5 delwt           4.10     0.395     10.4  5.62e- 25
    ## 6 gaweeks        11.5      1.47       7.88 4.06e- 15
    ## 7 parity         95.5     40.5        2.36 1.83e-  2
    ## 8 smoken         -4.85     0.587     -8.27 1.78e- 16

By a glance, we could find 7 potentially significant predictors(with
smallest p-value):
`babysex`,`bhead`,`bleangth`,`delwt`,`gaweeks`,`parity` and `smoken`.
Those information about baby, such as length at birth, or head
circumference at birth are obviously associated with birth weight, thus,
I’m interested in other predictors. Moreover, given the relationship
between mother and baby, I would like to choose those variables which
reflecting mothers condition, such as `delwt`,`gaweeks`, `parity`,
`smoken`, as predictors in the model.

``` r
fit_model = lm(bwt ~ delwt + gaweeks + parity + smoken, data = baby_df)
```

``` r
fit_model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 3
    ##   term        estimate   p.value
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)  -158.   8.69e-  2
    ## 2 delwt           5.65 3.91e- 72
    ## 3 gaweeks        62.9  7.26e-168
    ## 4 parity        115.   8.30e-  2
    ## 5 smoken         -7.01 2.72e- 14

Create a plot of model residuals against fitted values

``` r
fit_df = 
  baby_df %>% 
  select(bwt, delwt, gaweeks, parity, smoken) %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(fit_model) %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(fit_model)
fit_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", linetype = 2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Plot of model residuals against fitted values",
    x = "Predictions",
    y = "Residuals"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw6_cy2588_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

Comparing models:

``` r
model_1 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = baby_df)
model_2 = lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = baby_df)
```

``` r
cv_df =
  crossv_mc(baby_df, 200) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))
```

``` r
cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    fit_model  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ delwt + gaweeks + parity + smoken, data = .x)),
    model_1  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    model_2  = map(train, ~gam(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = as_tibble(.x)))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_fit_model  = map2_dbl(fit_model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_1  = map2_dbl(model_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_2  = map2_dbl(model_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```

Make a plot to show the result

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

## Problem 3

Get data

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
